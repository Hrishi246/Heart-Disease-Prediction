# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Data set source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease
In this project, I predicted whether a patient had a heart attack or not based on parameters like age, sex, blood pressure and some 
other features.
Stages of the project:
1. Installing all the required libraries
2. Identifying missing data
3. Missing data imputaion
4. One hot encoding 
5. Building preliminary Classification tree
6. Performing cost complexity pruning.
7. Improving accuracy by hyperparameter tuning (alpha tuning)
8. Predicting result based on optimized Decision tree classifier
9. Visualizing decision trees for better understanding.
